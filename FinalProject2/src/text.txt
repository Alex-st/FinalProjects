This is a popular Java Generics interview question. It comes in my mind little late. It didn't come when I first know about generics in Java but a while later, nevertheless I find it quite useful to know about how generics works in java behind the scene. The buzzing keyword is "Type Erasure", you guessed it right itâ€™s the same thing we used to in our schools for erasing our mistakes in writing or drawing :). Same thing is done by Java compiler, when it sees code  written using Generics it completely erases that code and covert it into raw type i.e. code without Generics.
